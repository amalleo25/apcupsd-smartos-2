# apcupsd-smartos

This script will setup apcupsd in the global zone as a network slave. In my case, I have apcupsd installed on a raspberry pi which is connected to the UPS via USB and talks to the slaves.

Tested on SmartOS 20160721T174418Z

At the time of this write up, 3.14.14 is the latest version of apcupsd.
